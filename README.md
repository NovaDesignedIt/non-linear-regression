# Purpose:
## Fit data using non-linear regression least-squares method for an exponential function.
For the data in the file, the function has the form 𝑁 =𝑎𝑒𝑏𝑥 where 𝑎 and 𝑏 are constants that are 
determined from the fit. Until the user wishes to quit the application should do the following: <br/>
• Read data from a file <br/>
• Print the data  <br/>
• Print report summary of the data (mean, median, range, mood, and standard Deviation) <br/>
• Do an exponential fit and print the regression equation <br/>
• Compute how accurate your exponential fit (Standard Error) <br/>
• Offer an interpolation/extrapolation of both the prognostic index. <br/>
